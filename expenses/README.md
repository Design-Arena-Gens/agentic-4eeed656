## Minimal Expense Tracker

This project is a minimalist, client-first expense tracking dashboard built with Next.js 14, Tailwind CSS (v4), and TypeScript. All data is stored locally in the browser, so you can experiment freely without needing an account or backend.

### Features
- Add expenses with description, amount, date, category, and optional notes
- Save entries to local storage for persistent tracking on a single device
- Filter by month, category, and search term
- Category breakdown with proportional bars and headline metrics
- Clean, responsive layout that adapts to mobile and desktop

### Getting Started
```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Then open http://localhost:3000 to start tracking.

### Production Build
```bash
npm run build
npm start
```

Deploys are configured to work seamlessly with Vercel.
